The website's main feature is a generative AI-powered search bar that uses the preferences input by users to generate a list of suggested holiday destinations. 

## How to Use: 
To access the search bar, click on "Start Saerching".


To use the search bar, users should key in their preferred holiday destination and activities, and a compilation of cities and countries associated with those interests will be generated for you.
